# EMRSystem
This group assignment for Advanced Programming module from Taylor's University is a simple Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System to keep track of patients’ medical history. 

### Scenario - (Simple Digital Healthcare System – Patients’ Medical History)
Covid-19 struck in early 2020 and surprised the world with its rapid and widespread transmission, high mortality rate, and lack of effective treatments and vaccines. In the beginning phase, many countries underestimated the outbreak's severity and did not implement swift actions to contain its spread. As the virus continued to spread rapidly, governments and health authorities worldwide began to implement strict safety measures, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing, to slow the spread of the virus and prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, the global healthcare systems were unprepared for such a large-scale pandemic, and eventually, the healthcare systems in some countries quickly collapsed.
The pandemic had a profound impact on public health, the economy, and social life. Many countries were experiencing high numbers of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The situation persisted for many months as the virus spread globally until the covid-19 vaccines were discovered.
The devastating effect of Covid-19 triggers the medical industry to respond rapidly with better, faster systems that could detect and contain the outbreak.
The Covid-19 pandemic inadvertently created a new opportunity for a new normal for digital health, among them the introduction of many digital systems that could potentially improve the quality of life, such as integrated Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and Electronic Health Records (EHR), infectious disease tracking and many more.
